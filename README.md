# testing with GPT
This experiment is all about making GPT to do other things than just talking through prompts. for example, tic_tac_toe with GPT is using GPT to change prompt into actual gameplay and in reverse too. currently(v1.1) I'm having issue with prompt that GPT aren't following my instructions.

once, I'm done with this tic tac toe, I'm going to make the chess since it was the goal for my GPT project. and I'm planning to use Arduino so to make GPT to control the robot itself.

maybe fine-tuning GPT might work better but I'm still figuring out how to fine_tune GPT better because fine_tuning requires system,quesion,and answer prompt. cause I don't use questions in my project. I only provide the GPT the information for example, in tic tac toe, current grid/cell status and its row and col.

v1.2 Known issues:
현재 GPT가 말이 너무 많아서 게임이 원래 계획했던대로 작동하지 않는 문제가 있습니다.
해결은 시간내에 어려울것 같습니다.
